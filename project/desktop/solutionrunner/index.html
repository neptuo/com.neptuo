                    <p>Keyboard-only designed application for simple and fast opening of Visual Studio solution files.
Configuration takes single folder where to look for *.sln files with the option to set prefered Visual Studio version installed on your computer and global (Windows wide) shortcut.</p>
<p>After setting required configuration, main window will open. Here you can filter solution files from your hard drive and manage favourite ones.
By pressing enter, you run a new instance of selected Visual Studio version with the selected solution.</p>
<p>When global hotkey is set, the application is only minimized after opening the solution. So, to update it must first kill it from process list.</p>
<p>To start the application after sign in to the Windows, simple create shortcut in startup folder. We are currentling implementing this as feature, along with minimized startup.</p>

                                                It is quite possible that you would need to unistall previous version and install new one, because our server moved to HTTPS.

                                                Added additional command to all Visual Studios (and Code) which runs new instance as administrator.

                                            <li>
                                                Configuration is moved from ClickOnce internal storage to custom JSON file. Path can be change in configuration window.

                                                Solution Runner can search during initialization. There is cache of files available from previous run which is used during file system scanning.

                                                Fixed searching for x64 version of Visual Studio Code.

                                                Added an option to show a little badge after solution name with count of projects in the solution file.
